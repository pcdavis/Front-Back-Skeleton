Udemy course: build a serverless app with aws

To create a static site:
1. Open S3 and create a new bucket
2. The bucket contents (our website) is private by default. We need to make it public so browsers can access it. To do that, open the bucket and navigate to Permissions/Bucket Policy and paste the json code below (make sure to replace 'mybucketname' with the name of your bucket)

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policy1497053408897",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1497053406813",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucketname/*"
        }
    ]
}

Now the bucket will be public and accessible in the browser.
